        Group-Decision-Making</h2></u></ul></p>
       
<p>Organizations make decisions in a group, due mainly to two reasons (Mallach,<br>
    2000):
    </p><br>
<p>• task related reasons: have to do with functional demands and techniques<br>
    which make it impossible for a single person to make a decision; and<br>
    • organizational reasons: which demand that certain individuals participate<br>
    in the decision making process due to the functional, structural and legal<br>
    organization of the company.</p>   
<p>Involving lots of people in the decision making process provides a greater basis<br>
    of experience, knowledge, and creative insights. It is intuitively reasonable that<br>
    the chances of overlooking possible events and possible courses of actions are<br>
    diminished in group-decision-making. The synergy of individuals may make the<br>
    overall quality of the group decisions greater than the sum of parts. The<br>
    creations of juries, panels and cabinets as ways of reaching decisions can be<br>
    seen to be based on this promise.</p>
<p>However, if the opinion and values of individuals differ, how should the<br>
    differences be resolved? Difference of opinion may inhibit the expression of<br>
    critical ideas, resulting in an incomplete survey of alternative courses of action<br>
    or choices. Techniques to enhance group’s creative potential and interaction<br>
    such as Delphi, SODA (Strategic Options Development and Analysis), and<br>
    even the brainstorming process are widely used.
    </p>     
<p>The main difference of a group activity from an individual activity is the<br>
    opportunity for interaction among the group members, which enriches the<br>
    discussion and the analysis of the problem and provides a more objective<br>
    choice of alternatives to resolve the problem. Today, the richness deriving from<br>
    interaction can be obtained in various ways, since we have gotten beyond the<br>
    phase of meeting around a table or telephone consultations and conventional<br>
    mail, and we have the technology of e-mail, audio, and video conferencing.<br>
    Consultations, information surveys, mergers, and big business deals can take<br>
    place by means of group decisions with no need for the parties to be physically<br>
    present at the same place.</p>
<p>Some of the well-known group-decision methods are: (Warfield, 1976;<br>
    Poulton, 1994):<br>
    </p>   
<p>• brainstorming,<br>
    • Q-sort method,<br>
    • Delphi method,<br>
    • NGT – Nominal Group Technique,<br>
    • SODA – Strategic Options Development and Analysis, and<br>
    • GDSS – electronic meetings via video conferencing and e-mail using<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Flow system.
    </p>  
<p><u><h3>Brainstorming</h3></u></p>
<p>Brainstorming is a meeting held to extend the discussion of a given problem<br>
    stimulating the creativity and the discovery of new solutions or new directions<br>
    to the problem. The informal type of discussion helps greater participation of<br>
    the members of the group but a good control of the discussion as well as the<br>
    documentation of important facts and results are essential.</p>
<p><u><h3>Q-SORT</h3></u></p>  
<p>Q-SORT is a group decision process where each participant structures the<br>
    decision problem, sorting a set of declarations according to his or her<br>
    preference. Each participant receives a set of cards containing the declarations<br>
    about the problem. A scaling measure is used to guide the sorting process of<br>
    the declarations. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be repeated<br>
    many times using different sorting criteria for the problem.
    </p>  
<p><u><h3>Delphi</h3></u></p>     
<p>Delphi is known as a methodology useful to generate, clarify, structure, and<br>
    organize a set of ideas. The methodology collects and evaluates information or<br>
    expert’s opinion with respect to a main subject. It is not allowed for persons<br>
    of the group to maintain communication among them. A supervisory team
    </p>
<p>selects a group of 30 to 100 experts giving to each expert a questionnaire based<br>
    on the most significant answers received, the supervisory team prepares a new<br>
    questionnaire to be distributed among the same or a new group of experts. The<br>
    process continues until the supervisory team evaluates that a significant and<br>
    structured set of answers has been received to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Main characteristics of this method, based on description presented by<br>
    Goicoechea et al. (1982), are:
    </p> 
<p>•&nbsp; the method can be applied to small or large groups;<br>
    •&nbsp; face-to-face contact is not necessary, and in many cases not recom-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  mended;<br>
    •&nbsp; relies on written responses;<br>
    • &nbsp;respondents can be at different locations;<br>
    •&nbsp; may take more than 6 weeks to complete the decision process;<br>
    •&nbsp; group decision is made through aggregation of individual judgments,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually after three or more rounds of distribution and analysis of question-<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naires.</p> 
<p>The execution of Delphi is made through the following sequential steps:</p>   
<p>1.&nbsp; Develop the Delphi question that must be clearly and comprehensively<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formulated, reflecting the objective of the problem to be solved.</p>
    <p>    2.&nbsp; Select and contact participants that will be interested in the problem being<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examined, and with minimum level of expertise necessary to deal with the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problem.</p>
    <p>    3.&nbsp; Select a group of respondents among the participants contacted in step<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Suggested number of the sample group is 30 persons, but it can be more<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or less than 30 persons, depending on the problem to be analyzed.</p>
    <p>    4.&nbsp; Develop questionnaire number 1 and test. The purpose of this question-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;naire is to identify issues. This questionnaire should be tested on a small<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sample of persons that are not part of the respondents. After the test, the<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questionnaire is sent to the respondents.</p>
    <p>    5. &nbsp;Analysis of the questionnaire number 1. A decision-making staff prepares<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a concise list of items identified in the answers of questionnaire 1, and a<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;summary of comments made by the respondents.<br>
